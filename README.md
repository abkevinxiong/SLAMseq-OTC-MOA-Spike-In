# SLAMseq-OTC-MOA-Spike-In
SLAM-seq nascent transcription data with spike in controls (both ERCC and fly)

#This data is part of the UCD program, where primary hepatoctytes cultured in power media were perturbed by the OTC lead compounds: JAK1 inhibitors (cpd295, cpd304) and HSP90 inhibitors (cpd320,cpd322). Using SLAM-seq short labeling, cells were treated with compounds at 3uM for t=2 and t=17 timepoints. A synthetic spike in, ERCC, as well as S2 fly spike in cells were added to assist with normalization. We determine compounds effects on nascent transcription from this data, as well as other analysis using spike-ins.
